# HNG-Task 1: Slack Profile Card

This project is a part of my participation in the HNG Internship. The task involved creating a Slack Profile Card with the following features:

- **Slack Name**: My Slack name is displayed prominently using the `data-testid` attribute for easy identification and testing.

- **Slack Display Picture**: My Slack profile picture is showcased, and the image's `alt` attribute is set to my Slack username for accessibility.

- **Current Day of the Week**: The card indicates the current day of the week, dynamically updated to reflect the day (e.g., Monday, Tuesday).

- **Current UTC Time**: The card displays the current UTC time in milliseconds, providing real-time information.

- **Track**: I have mentioned my track, which is Frontend development.
